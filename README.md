# Titanic Survival Prediction

This project is aimed at predicting the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using machine learning techniques. It utilizes the famous Titanic dataset which contains information about passengers such as age, gender, ticket class, etc., and whether they survived the Titanic disaster.

This project is done as a part of "CodeAlpha Internship (Data Science)" Task_1

## Requirements

To run this project, you need Python 3.x along with the following libraries:

- pandas
- scikit-learn
- joblib

Install these dependencies using pip:

`pip install pandas scikit-learn joblib`


## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

`git clone https://github.com/your-username/titanic-survival-prediction.git`

2. Navigate to the project directory:

`cd titanic-survival-prediction`

3. Run the script:

`python titanic_prediction.py`

This will train a logistic regression model on the Titanic dataset, evaluate its performance, and save the trained model to disk. You can also use the `predict_survival` function in the script to make predictions on new data.

## File Descriptions

- `titanic_prediction.py`: Python script containing the code for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and saving the model.
- `logistic_regression_model.pkl`: Saved logistic regression model.
